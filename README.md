#IPL Data Analysis (2008–2025) using Power BI

Project Overview:
This project involved performing a comprehensive analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) data spanning 17 seasons (2008 to 2025). The objective was to extract actionable insights, player performance metrics, and team statistics, and visualize them in a highly interactive and professional Power BI dashboard.

Objectives:
•	Perform end-to-end data analytics using IPL historical match data.
•	Build a scalable, multi-page Power BI dashboard with drill-down, tooltips, and bookmarks.
•	Develop custom DAX measures to generate KPIs such as total runs, wickets, centuries, sixes, MVPs, etc.
•	Enable dynamic filtering and exploration by season, team, and player.

Key Features & Functionalities:
Data Ingestion & Transformation
•	Imported multiple CSV files into Power BI and cleaned data using Power Query Editor.
•	Merged datasets (match-level, player-level, team stats) to create a robust model.
•	Handled nulls, text-to-number conversions, and date parsing for seasonal analysis.
Data Modeling
•	Established relationships between fact and dimension tables.
•	Used star schema design for clean navigation and optimized performance.
•	Created calculated columns and custom tables for advanced metrics.
DAX Measures Developed
•	Total Runs, Wickets, 50s, 100s, Dot Balls, Fours, Sixes.
•	Dynamic MVP detection based on match-by-match performance.
•	Win Percentage, Season-wise Team Strength, Player Consistency Score.
Dashboard & Visualizations
•	Multi-page dashboard:
o	Overview Page – KPIs, total matches, total runs, MVPs, etc.
o	Team Analysis – wins, losses, performance trend per season.
o	Player Insights – best batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders.
o	Match Center – dynamic scorecards with slicers.
•	Interactive slicers for season, player, team, and venue.
•	Drill through pages for player and team deep-dives.
•	Bookmarks for guided storytelling.
•	Tooltips with additional contextual information on hover.

Highlights & Learnings:
•	Hands-on experience in building real-time dashboards for a massive dataset (~100K+ records).
•	Developed advanced DAX skills and gained deeper understanding of relationship modeling.
•	Followed BI design best practices: visual hierarchy, color coding, responsive layout.
•	Enhanced skills in storytelling using data, tooltips, and interactivity.
